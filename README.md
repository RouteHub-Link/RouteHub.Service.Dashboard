Or just run those commands:

```sh
# Clone the project

cd RouteHub.Client.Hub

# Copy .env.development to .env
cp .env.development .env

docker compose -f "docker-compose.hosted.yml" up -d --build
```

Do not forget the env variables in the client.

After those steps you can attach the client to the server. You can see the client in the dashboard.
You need to MQTT connection to the client for that compose you can use like this : 'localhost:1883' or your proxy link.
If the connection is not established you have to make sure service can reach the client mqtt container.
